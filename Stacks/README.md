# Stacks

You have learned how to create and use arrays, which are the most common type of data structure in CS. Sometimes we need some form of data structure where we have more control over adding and removing items. These data structure are stacks and queues.

A stack is an ordered collections of items that follow the **LIFO(Last In First Out)** principle. The addition of new items and removal of existing items takes place at the same end. The end of the stack is known as the top, and the opposite side is known as the base. The newest elements are near the top, and the oldest elements are near the base.

Some of the real life examples of stacks include a pile of books, or a stack of trays in a cafeteria or food court.

A stack is also used by compilers in programming language and by computer memory to store variables and method calls.

We are going to create a basic class of our stack and rise the bar as we go along  with this tutorial.
