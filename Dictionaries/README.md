# Dictionaries

Set, dictionaries store unique values. In a set, we are interested in the value itself as the primary element. In dictionary, we store values in pairs as `[key, value]`.

A **dictionary** is used to store `[key, value]` pairs, where the key is used to find a particular element. A dictionary is also known as a **map**. A **set** stores `[key, key]` collection of elements, and a dictionary stores a `[key, value]` collection of elements.
